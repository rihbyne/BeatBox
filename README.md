BeatBox
=======

  This java program is a GUI client which loops drumming patterns.The central grid has 16 x 16 checkboxes which you mark/unmark for designing a drum pattern.i am plannig to extend this program by making the patterns serializable,so loading the saved patterns becomes feasible feature.Currently the work is under contruction.i will sooner make a revise gist of BeatBox.
